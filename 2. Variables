Variables: 
In programming, a variable is a container for a value. You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer’s memory. Information stored in variables, such as a username, account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in memory.

In short, variables label and store data in memory. There are only a few things you can do with variables:

Create a variable with a descriptive name.
Store or update information stored in a variable.
Reference or “get” information stored in a variable. 

// Covering var, let and const keywords

    Create a Variable: var 
    EXAMPLE: var myName = 'Arya';
             console.log(myName);
             // Output: Arya 
             
1. var, short for variable, is a JavaScript keyword that creates, or declares, a new variable.
2. myName is the variable’s name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called camel casing. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything).
3. = is the assignment operator. It assigns the value ('Arya') to the variable (myName).
4. 'Arya' is the value assigned (=) to the variable myName. You can also say that the myName variable is initialized with a value of 'Arya'.
5. After the variable is declared, the string value 'Arya' is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: console.log(myName).

  Q1 Declare a variable named favoriteFood using the var keyword and assign to it the string 'pizza'.

  Answer:
    var favouriteFood = 'pizza';
