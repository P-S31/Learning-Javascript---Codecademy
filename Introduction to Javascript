Console:
// console.log();

Use the console.log code in the editor to log your age to the console.
console.log(6+6); 

On the next line, write another console.log to print out a different number representing the number of weeks youâ€™ve been programming.
console.log(1);

Comments: 
// or /* */
A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding it. 
For Example:  
        // Prints 5 to the console
        console.log(5);
        
A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.
For Example: /*
            This is all commented 
            console.log(10);
            None of this is going to run!
            console.log(99);
            */ 
You can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code:
For Example: 
            console.log(/*IGNORED!*/ 5);  // Still just prints 5 

Data Types: 
 Examples ==
  
  Number: console.log(2011);
  String: console.log('Javascript');
  Boolean: true or false (yes or no questions)
  Null: Absence of a value meaning 0 
  Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.
  Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now
    // First 6 are primitive data types
   
  Object: Collections of related data.
