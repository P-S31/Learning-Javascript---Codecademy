// or /* */
// A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding it.

console.log(5);

// A multi - line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.
// For Example:// 

/*
             This is all commented
console.log(10);
            None of this is going to run!
console.log(99);

//You can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code:
// For Example:
console.log(/*IGNORED!*/ 5);  // Still just prints 5
